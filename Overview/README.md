## Series Abstract

The Foundations Series lays the philosophical and conceptual groundwork for the entire HanFlow system. It articulates the unifying principles of embodied attention, relational presence, and non-forcing engagement that run through Tai Chi (movement), Tuina (touch), and mindful eating (nourishment).

Rather than treating the body as an object to optimize, these essays reframe it as a living partner in dialogue — a site of intelligence, rhythm, and quiet transformation. The series serves as the theoretical spine for all subsequent practice-oriented series.

**Abstract**  
This essay offers a clear definition of Tai Chi within the HanFlow framework — as a structured method of embodied attention training through slow, continuous, and circular movement. It distinguishes Tai Chi from common misconceptions (slow exercise, martial art, or seated meditation) and positions it as a practical tool for cultivating internal balance, stability, and presence in daily life.

**Core Concepts**  
- Embodied attention training  
- Movement as anchor of awareness  
- Yielding and non-forcing  
- Integration of posture, breath, and mind  

**Keywords**  
Tai Chi, embodied practice, attention training, mindful movement, HanFlow framework, non-forcing
