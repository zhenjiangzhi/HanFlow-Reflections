# Overview Document

## Plain Description

This document outlines the foundational framework of HanFlow — a cultural practice space centered on gentle self-care through Tai Chi, Tuina, and mindful movement.

## Core Ideas

Modern life often treats the body as something to manage, optimize, and push. Yet beneath data and discipline, a quiet disconnection can emerge. We may track our steps but lose the felt sense of being present.

HanFlow proposes a different orientation: returning to the body as a conversation partner rather than a performance project. Drawing on Tai Chi and Tuina traditions, this framework emphasizes slow, embodied engagement and sustainable self-care practices for everyday life.

## Scope of the Framework

This overview establishes the conceptual structure that informs the Tai Chi series, the Tuina series, and related practice essays within the HanFlow collection.
