## Abstract

The HanFlow Framework proposes an embodied cultural approach to gentle self-care rooted in traditional Chinese practices. Rather than treating the body as a system to optimize or control, HanFlow invites a relational orientation — engaging movement, touch, and nourishment as ongoing conversations with lived experience.

Drawing from Tai Chi (mindful movement), Tuina (attentive therapeutic touch), and mindful eating (five tastes awareness, seasonal rhythm, and relational nourishment), the framework articulates a slow, sustainable, and practice-based model of everyday regulation. It establishes the conceptual foundation for the Tai Chi Series, Tuina Series, Food Series, and related essays within the HanFlow collection.

## Plain Description

Modern life often treats the body as something to manage, optimize, and push. Beneath data and discipline, however, a quiet disconnection can emerge. We may track our steps yet lose the felt sense of presence.

HanFlow reorients this dynamic. It approaches the body not as a performance project, but as a conversation partner — cultivated through attentive movement, responsive touch, and rhythmic nourishment.

## Scope of the Framework

This overview establishes the conceptual structure that informs:

- TaiChi Series – mindful movement and yielding intelligence  
- Tuina Series – regulation through attentive contact  
- z-Food Series – relational nourishment and five tastes awareness  

Together, these series form the broader HanFlow collection.
