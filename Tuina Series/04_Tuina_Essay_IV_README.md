# Essay IV — Touch as Attention  
The Most Neglected Sense in Modern Life

## Plain Description

This essay explores why touch — the most fundamental of senses — has become so diminished, and what it means to recover it as a vehicle for presence.

## Core Ideas

We live through our distance senses: eyes on screens, ears in headphones. Touch — along with its close relatives, proprioception and interoception — has quietly atrophied. We know about our bodies, but we don't feel them. 

This numbness isn't the absence of sensation; it's an active damping, a protective response to overload. But touch is different from other senses. It requires proximity. It demands reciprocity. To touch is to be touched in return. 

When we bring attention back to touch — even something as simple as feeling the weight of our own hand — we begin to restore the sensory ground of presence. Not as a technique, but as a homecoming.

Real-world application: Right now, without changing position, feel the points where your body meets the chair, the floor, the air. Just register. This is not a relaxation exercise — it's a remembering. A return to the felt sense of being here.

Part of the Tuina series within the HanFlow framework, recovering touch as a primary channel of presence.
