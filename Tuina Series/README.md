## Series Abstract

The Tuina Series explores touch as a mode of relational intelligence rather than mechanical correction. Through seven essays, it reframes the body as a dialogue partner — one that responds to listening, cooperation, and seasonal timing rather than force or control.

Rather than positioning Tuina as technique alone, this series presents attentive touch as a philosophical orientation: a discipline of presence, receptivity, and mutual responsiveness that extends beyond treatment into daily living.
