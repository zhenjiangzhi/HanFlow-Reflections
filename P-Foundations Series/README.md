## Series Abstract

The P-Foundations Series lays the theoretical foundation for the entire HanFlow system.  
It articulates the core principles of embodied attention, non-forcing engagement, relational dialogue with the body, and rhythmic living — concepts that thread through all three practice domains: movement (Tai Chi), touch (Tuina), and nourishment (mindful eating).

These essays are not technique manuals, but invitations to reframe the body as a living partner rather than an object to be managed, optimized, or fixed.  
They serve as the intellectual backbone for the more practice-oriented series that follow.

**Abstract**  
This essay offers a clear definition of Tai Chi within the HanFlow framework — as a structured method of embodied attention training through slow, continuous, and circular movement. It distinguishes Tai Chi from common misconceptions (slow exercise, martial art, or seated meditation) and positions it as a practical tool for cultivating internal balance, stability, and presence in daily life.

**Core Concepts**  
- Embodied attention training  
- Movement as anchor of awareness  
- Yielding and non-forcing  
- Integration of posture, breath, and mind  

**Keywords**  
Tai Chi, embodied practice, attention training, mindful movement, HanFlow framework, non-forcing, dynamic balance
