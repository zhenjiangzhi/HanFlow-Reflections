# Essay V — Bridge  
When Stillness Begins to Move

## Plain Description

A short transitional piece that asks a simple but profound question: how do we carry the quality of attentive stillness into motion?

## Core Ideas

It’s one thing to feel centered while standing still; it’s another to maintain that centeredness when we start to move, when life gets busy, when things shift. 

This essay sets up the next exploration: what does it mean to move without abandoning listening? To let action be an extension of awareness, not a break from it? 

The question is not theoretical — it’s the living heart of any practice that seeks to bring mindfulness off the cushion and into the stream of daily life.

Part of the Tai Chi series within the HanFlow framework, bridging stillness and motion.
