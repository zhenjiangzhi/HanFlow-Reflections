# Essay VII — Tai Chi as a Way of Living Attention

## Plain Description

The final essay in the series considers what happens when the practice of Tai Chi dissolves into everyday life — when it’s no longer something you “do,” but a way you pay attention.

## Core Ideas

A mature practice doesn’t stay on the mat. It leaks into the ordinary: standing at the sink, waiting in line, lifting a grocery bag. 

The same quality of attention cultivated in slow movement begins to colour all of life. You no longer ask “Am I doing this right?” — you simply notice “Here I am.” 

The boundary between practice and life softens. This is not about adding another task to your day; it’s about rediscovering that presence was never somewhere else. It was always here, waiting for you to arrive. 

The series ends where it began: with a conscious breath, and the recognition that this — right here — is enough.

Part of the Tai Chi series within the HanFlow framework, completing the arc from formal practice to lived awareness.
